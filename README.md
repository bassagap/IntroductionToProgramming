# Python Programming Introduction Project

This project provides an introduction to programming concepts and the Python language through Jupyter notebooks. It includes theory notebooks covering fundamental topics and lab notebooks with practical exercises for hands-on learning.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `theory_notebooks`: Contains Jupyter notebooks covering theoretical concepts of Python programming.
- `lab_notebooks`: Contains Jupyter notebooks with practical exercises for applying Python programming concepts.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-introduction-project.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd python-introduction-project
```

3. Choose the desired notebook to explore:

* For theoretical concepts, explore the notebooks in the theory_notebooks directory.
* For practical exercises, explore the notebooks in the lab_notebooks directory.
Open the Jupyter notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

4. a) Open the Jupyter notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
```bash
jupyter notebook  # For Jupyter Notebook
```
or
```bash
jupyter lab  # For Jupyter Notebook
```

4. b) Alternatively, you can use Google Colab to open and run the notebooks directly from the browser:

Go to Google Colab.
Click on the "GitHub" tab.
Enter the URL of the repository (https://github.com/yourusername/python-introduction-project) and press Enter.
Select the desired notebook from the list of files and click on it to open.


## Branches:

* master: Contains the theory notebooks and lab notebooks without solutions.
* solved_theory_X: Contains the theory notebooks with solutions for the respective theory lesson X.
